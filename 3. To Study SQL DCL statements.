‚úÖ Practical No. 3 ‚Äî To Study SQL DCL Statements
üìå Objective

To study and execute SQL DCL (Data Control Language) commands.

üß† What is DCL?

DCL stands for Data Control Language.
These commands are used to control access and permissions on the database.

‚úÖ DCL Commands List
Command	Purpose
GRANT	Give privileges to users
REVOKE	Remove privileges from users

Note: Some databases also consider DENY but mainly GRANT & REVOKE are used in SQL.

‚úÖ Example Scenario

Create a user and give database permissions.
(Run as admin user like root/system)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create User
CREATE USER testuser IDENTIFIED BY test123;

2Ô∏è‚É£ GRANT Privileges

Give permission to access and modify a table:

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON *.* TO 'testuser';


Grant all privileges:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'testuser';

3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Privileges

Login as testuser and execute:

SHOW GRANTS;

4Ô∏è‚É£ REVOKE Privileges

Remove update and delete rights:

REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE ON *.* FROM 'testuser';


Revoke all:

REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* FROM 'testuser';
